                        <h1>Source Info</h1>
                        <p>I used the CSS Reset from meyerweb, and for the form I used the same code from week 7 and
                            the FormSpree Website.</p>
                        <h1>Challanges</h1>
                        <p> What wasn't challenging!? I had the hardest time fixing my invisible scroll wheel, I got
                            it to show up when it was small but also be invisible when the screen was large, my next
                            biggest problem was realizing I had to have a whole page for each of these things! My
                            design was very minimalisic and was going to have everything on one page, then I re-read
                            the rubric and relized I had to create 7 extra pages from scratch!<br>

                            As for the challenges specifically, I think they were all exceptionally hard, one of the 
                            harder things I did was trying in vain for two hours trying to fit javascript canvas' 
                            into div. I eventually reached out to a fellow classmate to ask them what they did, and 
                            ended up taking their advice to have links to the programs by themselves. But 
                            Reward wise, The scroll wheel getting it to work on firefox where I needed it to be and
                            there was no template used.<br> My biggest disappointment was not being able to figure out
                            how to change the colors. That is why theres a bunch of buttons of various colors that dont
                            really do anything. Outside of creating a whole new set of each webpage for everything I
                            just didn't know what to do!?.</p>
