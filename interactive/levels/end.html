        <p>Audience: Male, children to young teens, anyone who likes explosions. They will look for it when
                they have too much free time, or want to cause mayhem in a controlled environment. It will
                probably be an interactive site designed to allow young children to click and drag for a short
                amount of time, just long enough before their attention span runs out.</p>
        <h2><br>My wireframes</h2>
        <img src="/igme230/interactive/assets/wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframes">
        <p>I choose a set of colors that would appeal to a younger audence, very simple and vibrant. I wanted Images I could make myself and choose a fun typeface to appeal to a younger audience </p>
    <h3><br>Used Items</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp">w3school:</a> I used a lot of refrences from w3, however I took this code practicly word for word. It fit perfectly and couldn't see a way to change it and make it better.</li>
        <li><a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">MeyreWeb:</a> I used to reset my css.</li>
        <li><a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.JS:</a> I used as my JS libary and to do all the cool animations. </li>
        <li><a href="https://giphy.com/">Giphy:</a> I used some images from Giphy as the rewards to solving the puzzle. However it's directly linked to the giphy page so they arn't in my code.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube: </a>The Explosion I used for the final bomb has sound as well.</li>
        <li><a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery:</a> Was also used as a supplement to animate.js!</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.kevinandamanda.com/fonts/freescrapbookfonts/">free scrapbook fonts:</a> Is where I got my font!</li>
        <li> <br> All the rest of the code and images are made from scratch! (It probably shows) The most difficult thing was trying to make it so that if the flame was on the fuse it would light, took me forever!</li>
