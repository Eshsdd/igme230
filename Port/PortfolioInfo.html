                        <h1>Source Info</h1>
                        <p>I used the CSS Reset from meyerweb, and for the form I used the same code from week 7 and the FormSpree Website.</p>
                        <h1>Challanges</h1>
                        <p> What wasn't challanging??? I had the hardest time fixing my invisible scroll wheel, I got it to show up when it was small but also be invisible when the screen was large, my next biggest problem was realizing I had to have a whole page for each of these things! My design was very minamilisic and was going to have everything on one page, then I re-read the rubric and relized I had to create 7 extra pages. So lond story short I've been awake for over 24 hours and the sleep depravation alone is enough to consider it a challange.<br> As for the challenges, I think they we're all exceponally hard, one of the harder things I did was trying in vain for two hours trying to fit javascript canvas' into div's. But Reward wise, The scroll wheel getting it to work on firefox where i needed it to be and there was no template used.<br> My biggest dissapointment was not being able to figure out how to change the colors. Outside of creating a whole new set of each webpage.</p>
